Talk about the parts you think will be difficult (doing the modeling? preparing the data? keeping team members on-task?) and how you plan to address them. Specifically list out goals for yourself in terms of these challenges. I will check in with you throughout the semester on how you are progressing with these goals in order to help you succeed. Talk about why each team member was given each of their duties and responsibilities. Talk about your overall goals for the project. What are the things you are hoping to accomplish for this project to be considered a success? Is it an accuracy goal? Is it being able to explain a complex question in an easy way? Is it to add new insight to an important problem? Be as specific as possible. During your final presentation I will be looking for whether or not you achieved these goals, so they must be clearly defined and not overly broad.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"V6gc4aX26uKZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Manager Repsonse:\n","\n","For this project, we are wanting to look into the Tornados Data set, provided by Kaggle. When it comes to formatting, I am not worried that much as this data set does not contain any null values and is pretty organized. That makes it a little easier to work with and allows us to focus on the modeling side of things.\n","\n","When it comes to modeling, I expect there to be a few challenges here, I don't think the data will model how I or we are epxecting it to. Based on previous experiences, it takes a few model runs and testing to get correct. With these models, we are wanting to **show what type of tornado could occur next**, **where this type of tornado could occur**, **and why**.\n","\n","In terms of this dataset, I am excited to work with this and un pack a little more knowledge when it comes to weather. Right we are splitting up the tasks so that me (Austen), and Joe will focus on the modeling as Milo works on formatting. But in this case since the data is formatted pretty well, we are focusing on renaming and keeping what columns will be useful for us. We will also be setting up the slides ealier in advance so that we can start brain\"storming\" on a layout and story.\n","\n","Based on our first meeting, I think keeping everybody on task wont really be a issue. I am happy to hear that Milo will be visiting a graduate school, but will be able to keep contact and work on smaller tasks. Not only that, but we will also hold meetings when the team members are free for updates, so everybody is on the same page.\n","\n","I look foward to this project and finding out or making a breakthrough about tornadoes and presenting a good story.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"rxyES4uV6su5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Approved by Dr. Savala on: XX/XX/XXXX"],"metadata":{"id":"vVcSFuoXmmiy"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Yk7cqReAl3_q"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}]}
